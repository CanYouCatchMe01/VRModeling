# VRModeling
A modeling software inspired by [Dust3D](https://dust3d.org/). 
Using the open source VR game engine [StereoKit](https://stereokit.net/), which is specifically made the make VR apps.
To generate the mesh I the open source library [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library).
I use the the CGAL C# bindings [CGALDotNet](https://github.com/Scrawk/CGALDotNet).
